        <h2>What is I-Ching</h2>
        <p>"I-Ching", one of the classical Chinese books, is a divination book used in ancient China to deduce future
            good and bad luck. "I-Ching" uses a set of symbolic forms to systematically describe the changes in things,
            expressing the philosophy and cosmology of Chinese classical culture. Its central idea is to use hexagrams
            composed of Yin and Yang symbols to represent the status of all things in the world. Fortune-tellers ask
            questions from the gods and obtain hexagrams to predict the success or failure of events (such as wars,
            political affairs, agricultural harvests, etc.). The influence of the "I-Ching" is not limited to
            divination. The idea of ​​Yin and Yang changes can be seen in all aspects of ancient Chinese philosophy,
            religion, politics, economics, medicine, astronomy, arithmetic, literature, music, art, military, and
            martial arts.</p>

        <h2>Interpretations of "I" (易 Yi)</h2>
        <p>The word "I" (易 Yi) has many interpretations:
            <br>①Easy, simple. </br>
            <br>②The meaning of change and change means that everything in the world is constantly changing.</br>
            <br>③Transaction, that is, the mutual changes of the decrease of Yin energy and the increase of Yang energy,
            and the
            decrease of Yang energy and and the increase of Yin energy. </br>
            <br>④The sun(日) and moon(月) compose the word Yi(易), symbolizing the energy of Yang and Yin. </br>
            <br>⑤The sunrise. </br>
            <br>⑥Zheng Xuan, the philosopher of the Han Dynasty, his work "I-Lun" believed that the name "I"(Yi) has
            three
            meanings: one is "simplicity"; the other is "change", and the other is "no change." Therefore, we can
            explain "I"(Yi) as: "simplification",
            "change", and "constancy".</br>
        </p>

        <h2>Meanings of Hexagrams</h2>
        <p>Yao (爻 Yao): The content of the I-Ching is composed of "hexagrams", with a total of sixty-four hexagrams.
            Each hexagram is composed of six layers, and each layer is called a "Yao". Each layer uses a long horizontal
            line "—" to represent Yang, which is called "Yang Yao"; or two broken horizontal lines "--" represent Yin,
            which is called "Yin Yao". There are six Yao in total, and the six Yao are combined with different Yin and
            Yang to form sixty-four different combinations.
